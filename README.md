# Occupancy Monitoring System
IIITA | SE Project '22

You are required to develop GUI enabled real-time occupancy monitoring system for lllTA buildings e.g. Auditorium. The system should be able to automatically register each individual's check-in and check-out concerning any building and present clear visual warnings and alerts based on the defined occupancy threshold of the building. The system should display regular updates regarding vacancy and make sure that no one enters the building if the place is fully occupied. Irrespective of the number of available entries and exits into the building all the applications must be in sync to display the same updated information.
